### Methods to solve problems
* Flowcharts
* Pseudocode
* Algorithm - This is the most important part of DSA

### FlowCharts
**Components**
* **Terminator** - For Start and End
* **Input/Output**
* **Process Block** - To declare or print
* **Decision Making Block**
* **Arrows**
* **Connector**

### Pseudocode
Detailed but readable description of what a computer program or algorithm must do.

**Example**

Start Program
Enter Two Numbers A and B
Subtract The Two Numbers
Print The Output
End Program
